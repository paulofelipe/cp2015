\title{Data for NAFTA's tariff reductions simulation in Caliendo and Parro (2015)}
\format{
A named list of 7 elements: sets, intermediate_consumption, final_consumption,
trade, deficit, and theta.
\itemize{
\item sets. A named list of vectors containing all regions and all sectors in data.
\item intermediate_consumption. A data.frame with 4 columns containing intermediate consumption data:
\itemize{
\item input. The input sector.
\item sector. The user sector.
\item sector. The user region.
\item value. The intermediate consumption value (tariffs-inclusive).
}
\item final_consumption. A data.frame with 3 columns containing final consumption data:
\itemize{
\item sector. The sector.
\item region. The consumer region.
\item value. The final consumption value (tariffs-inclusive).
}
\item value_added. A data.frame with 3 column containing value added ("labor") data:
\itemize{
\item sector. The user sector.
\item region. The user region.
\item value. The value added.
}
\item trade. A data.frame with 5 columns containing the bilateral trade and tariff data:
\itemize{
\item sector. The sector.
\item exporter. The exporter region.
\item importer. The importer region.
\item value. The trade value (net of tariffs).
\item tariff. The original tariffs in the database.
\item tariff_bln. The tariffs in the baseline scenario. Usually the same
original tariffs are used, but this is not mandatory.
\item tariff_cfl. The tariffs in the counterfactual scenario.
\item d_bln. The relativie change in iceberg trade costs in the baseline scenario (1 = no change).
\item d_cfl. The relativie change in iceberg trade costs in the counterfactual scenario (1 = no change).
As the model solution is in exact changes, the initial value can be set
to 1 and changes can be set proportionally.
}
\item deficit. A data.frame with 4 columns containing the deficit data?
\itemize{
\item region. The region.
\item D. The original deficit in the database.
}
\item theta. A data.frame with 2 columns containing the trade elasticities:
\itemize{
\item sector. The sector.
\item value. The theta (trade elasticity) parameter value.
}
}
}
\usage{

\description{
This data is used to replicate the results of Caliendo and Parro (2015) for
(only) NAFTA's tariff reductions. In addition, it shows the data structure
needed to use this package.

The data structure has been modified for compatibility with the package.
Therefore, the data are not in the original format provided by Caliendo and Parro (2015).
The original data is available at: \url{https://academic.oup.com/restud/article/82/1/1/1547758#supplementary-data}.
